Which jobs are most crucial?
Planning of the project and the division of the job are most crucial.


Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
First, we need to get the most basic working version of Tetris. Then, we will add features such as ForceDrop and rotating the screen.


Which components are prerequisites for others?
UML and flowchart


Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
The planning of the project, including UML diagrams and flowcharts, should be collaboratively tackled. The coding of the classes can delegated.


What is the timeline, and how does it accommodate setbacks, course changes?

May 30: completion of UML diagrams
May 31: flowcharts
June 4: basic working version of Tetris
June 9: completion of Tetris with added features

This timeline gives us time to test and change our code if something is not working properly.
