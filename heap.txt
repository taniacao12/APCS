HW#48 -- Heap o’Trouble
2018-05-13

One Way: 
    Adding to a Heap:
    1. Iterate through _heap
        a) If the addValue is greater than the current index's value, add
           addValue to (current index - 1)
        b) If the iteration reaches the last element and addValue is smaller
           than the last element, add addValue to the end of the heap

    Removing from a Heap:
    1. Create new Arraylist _temp
    2. Add all elements in _heap to _temp except the last element
    3. Set _heap as _temp

Second Way:
    Adding to a Heap:
    1. Add addValue to the end of _heap

    Removing from a Heap:
    1. Create new Arraylist _temp
    2. Find the index of the minValue
        a) Iterate through the list to find minValue using compareTo()
    3. Add all elements in _heap to _temp except minValue using index
       found in step 3
    4. Set _heap as _temp
